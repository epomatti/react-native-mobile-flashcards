# React Mobile Flashcards

## Installation

You'll need [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/) installed for local development:

```bash
yarn global add expo-cli
```

Install the dependencies and start the project:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

Or start directly on the Web with `yarn web`.
